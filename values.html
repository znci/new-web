      <h1>Our Core Values</h1>
      <p>
        At znci, we have 7 core values that we believe are essential to not only
        us, but to the web as a whole.
      </p>
      <section>
        <h2>1. Privacy</h2>
        <p>
          We believe that privacy is a fundamental human right. Privacy is the
          foundation of freedom, and without privacy, there is no freedom. We
          believe that privacy is essential to a free and open web.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>2. Accessibility</h2>
        <p>
          We believe in the 21st century, it's unacceptable that people are
          still being excluded from the web. Whether it's because of a
          disability, or because of a slow internet connection, we believe that
          everyone should be able to access the web.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>3. Open Source</h2>
        <p>
          We believe that open source is the future of software development.
          Open source software is more secure, more reliable, and more
          trustworthy than closed source software. While not all of our services
          are open-source, we strongly believe open-source is the future.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>4. There's no such thing as a stupid question</h2>
        <p>
          We believe that there's no such thing as a stupid question. We believe
          that everyone should be able to ask questions without fear of being
          judged.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>5. Competition drives innovation</h2>
        <p>
          We believe that competition is important. We believe that competition
          drives innovation, and that without competition, the web would be a
          much worse place. Unfortunately, the web is dominated by a few large
          companies, and we believe that this is a problem.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>6. Free Speech is a fundamental human right</h2>
        <p>
          Censorship kills creativity and innovation. We believe that free
          speech is why the web is as developed as it is today. We believe that
          free speech is a fundamental human right, and that everyone should be
          able to express their opinions without fear of being censored or
          loosing opportunities.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>

          these 7 core values, we've outlined what we believe is important to
          the web. We believe that you can build a better web.
